# iOS App Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my iOS app development learning journey! I'm using two primary resources to learn: [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) and [iOS 13 & Swift 5 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/).

## Hacking with Swift
[Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) is a free resource that provides a structured learning path for Swift programming language and iOS app development. The platform offers practical projects, challenges, and tutorials to help beginners and experienced programmers alike. 

## iOS 13 & Swift 5 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp
[iOS 13 & Swift 5 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) is an online course that teaches iOS app development from scratch. The course covers Xcode, Swift, UIKit, Firebase, and more. 

I'm excited to learn and build functional iOS apps through these resources. Follow along with my progress and feel free to connect with me.
